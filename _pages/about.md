Hi, I am Lechen! I am a first-year Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Tal August](https://talaugust.github.io/). I am particularly interested in the generalization and robustness of large language models (LLMs), especially their efficient learning and reasoning capabilities in out-of-domain settings. My recent research focuses on evaluating and improving LLM personalization, with the goal of aligning general model behavior more effectively with downstream tasks and user needs.

Previously, I earned my master's degree from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) and my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). During my time at Michigan, I was a member of [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/) advised by Professor [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/), and also worked with Professor [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/) as part of the [Launch Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/home). 

You can find my CV [here](assets/pdf/cv_lechen.pdf).
